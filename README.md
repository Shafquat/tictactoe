# tictactoe
This module stores the functions and classes needed for a Tic-Tac-Toe game,
including the grid class that stores the current game state, and the functions
that are used to test its functionality. The Tic-Tac-Toe game is played with
two players ("X" and "O"), who take turns marking a 3x3 board with their symbol.
The game ends when one player gets three of their symbol in a straight line, or
the grid is completely filled with symbols.
